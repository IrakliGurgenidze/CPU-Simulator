In collaboration with GDauterman,

A high-level simulation of a modern operating system in C++, focusing on assessing and documenting the efficiency of various CPU process scheduling algorithms under diverse operating conditions. 

The simulation environment was built from scratch, incorporating a sophisticated performance logging system. This system tracked critical metrics including average CPU burst time, average process wait time, average process turnaround time, and overall CPU utilization.

Scheduling algorithms implemented:
 - First come first serve
 - Shortest job next
 - Shortest remaining time
 - Round Robin
